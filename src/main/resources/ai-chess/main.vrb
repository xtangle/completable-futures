\frametitle{Search: Alpha-Beta Pruning}
\begin{itemize}
\item Problem with Minimax: too expensive
\item Prune the game tree by not considering irrelevant branches
\item Alpha $=$ Value of the best possible move you can make, that you have computed so far
\item Beta $=$ Value of the best possible move your opponent can make, that you have computed so far
\item If at any time Alpha $>=$ Beta, then your opponent can force a worse position than your best move so far, so there's no need to evaluate this move
\item Initially, start the search with Alpha $= -\infty$ and Beta $= \infty$
\end{itemize}
